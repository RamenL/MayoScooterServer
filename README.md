# MayoScooterMavenServer
This project was done for the Mayo Business Competition at TCNJ 2018-2019. There are four parts to this project: the Java server, the SQL JDBC server, the IOS application, and the Raspberry PI chip on the scooter. The Java server has handlers that connect to the JDBC server. The Raspberry Pi and the IOS make HTTP requests to the Java Server that then uses its Handlers to connect to the SQL and return the query results in a JSON format. This Git Repo only contains the Java Server.
